Before running the program, please be sure to put in your API credentials inside secret.py - not that I don't trust you guys, but for general safety I don't want to include my own :). Sorry if this
causes any trouble for you!

Running main.py runs the game itself, and the game instructions are shown to the player when ran.

This program is able to take any two twitter handles and filter them down to the desired texts through the "twoTwitter" class. The game statistic that is kept is how many guesses you got right out of
the total amount of guesses. That is all there is to it!
